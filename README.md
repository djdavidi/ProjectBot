# ProjectBot

A Side Project Generator that works by letting users progress from the tools API's and datasets available to an idea, instead of the
other way around.


ProjectBot uses cheerio and request to scrape data from sites about different available tools to use.
It is built using the MEAN stack, Mongo, express, and node.js on the backend, and Angular on the front end.
